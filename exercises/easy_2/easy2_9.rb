each_cons (Part 1)
The Enumerable#each_cons method iterates over the members of a collection taking each sequence of n consecutive elements at a time and passing them to the associated block for processing. It then returns a value of nil.

Write a method called each_cons that behaves similarly for Arrays, taking the elements 2 at a time. The method should take an Array as an argument, and a block. It should yield each consecutive pair of elements to the block, and return nil.

Your method may use #each, #each_with_object, #each_with_index, #inject, loop, for, while, or until to iterate through the Array passed in as an argument, but must not use any other methods that iterate through an Array or any other collection.

## Problem ##
# input - array
# output - nil
# rules
#   1) take/require a block
#   2) pass each pair of consecutive elements to the block


def each_cons_v1(arr)
  idx, size = 0, arr.size

  loop do
    break if idx > size - 2
    yield(arr[idx], arr[idx + 1])
    idx +=1
  end

  nil
end

def each_cons(arr)
  size = arr.size

  arr.each_with_index do |ele, idx|
    break if idx > size - 2

    yield(ele, arr[idx + 1])
  end

  nil
end


## Examples ##


hash = {}
result = each_cons([1, 3, 6, 10]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p result == nil
p hash == { 1 => 3, 3 => 6, 6 => 10 }

hash = {}
result = each_cons([]) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == {}
p result == nil

hash = {}
result = each_cons(['a', 'b']) do |value1, value2|
  hash[value1] = value2
end
p hash == {'a' => 'b'}
p result == nil


## Algorithm ##

# 1) initialize local variables:
#     `idx` - for tracking index position in the input array
#     `size` - size of the array
# 2) Iterate over the elements in the input array, with the index position available. On each iteration:
#     > quit if the index position is 1 less than `size`
#     > yield the current element and the next element to the block
# 3) return nil
